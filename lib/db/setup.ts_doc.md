# Database Setup Script Documentation

## Problem Solved
This script automates the setup process for the application's database and Stripe integration.

## Solution
It guides the user through setting up a Postgres database (local or remote), configuring Stripe, and generating necessary environment variables.

## Dependencies
- Node.js built-in modules: child_process, fs, util, readline, crypto, path, os
- Stripe CLI (external dependency)

## Testing Needs
- Dry-run option to verify the setup process without making actual changes
- Tests for different user input scenarios
- Error handling tests for various setup failures (e.g., Stripe CLI not installed, Docker issues)

## Notes
- This script should be run before starting the application for the first time
- Ensure clear instructions are provided for manual steps (e.g., Stripe CLI installation)
- Consider adding a verification step to check if the setup was successful

## Local Imports
