# Database Seed Script Documentation

## Problem Solved
This script populates the database with initial data, including a test user, team, and Stripe products.

## Solution
It creates a test user, associates them with a team, and sets up Stripe products and prices for the application's subscription plans.

## Dependencies
- Stripe integration from '../payments/stripe'
- Database connection and schema from './drizzle' and './schema'
- Password hashing function from '@/lib/auth/session'

## Testing Needs
- Dry-run option to verify the seeding process without affecting the database
- Verification of created data in both the database and Stripe
- Error handling tests for various scenarios (e.g., database connection issues, Stripe API failures)

## Notes
- This script should only be run in development or staging environments
- Ensure that the script is idempotent to prevent duplicate data on multiple runs
- Consider adding a cleanup function to remove seeded data if needed

## Local Imports
- '../payments/stripe': For Stripe operations
- './drizzle': For database connection
- './schema': For database schema
- '@/lib/auth/session': For password hashing
