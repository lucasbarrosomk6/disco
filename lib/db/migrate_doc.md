# migrate.ts Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file handles database migrations, allowing for version control and management of database schema changes throughout the application's lifecycle.

## Solution
The file exports functions or scripts that:
- Define database schema changes using Drizzle ORM
- Apply migrations to update the database structure
- Rollback migrations if needed
- Provide a way to check the current migration status

## Dependencies
- Drizzle ORM
- Database driver (likely pg for PostgreSQL)
- Possibly a custom migration script or utility

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for individual migration functions
- Integration tests to ensure migrations apply correctly
- Tests for migration rollback functionality
- Verification of database state after migrations

## Local File Imports
- Database configuration settings (likely from an environment file)
- Schema definitions or models from other files in the db folder
- Utility functions for database operations

Note: Ensure that all migrations are thoroughly tested before applying them to production databases.
