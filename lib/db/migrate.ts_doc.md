# Database Migration Script Documentation

## Problem Solved
This script handles the database migration process for the application, ensuring that the database schema is up-to-date with the latest changes.

## Solution
It uses Drizzle ORM's migration tools to apply database migrations. The script also handles the creation and validation of migration folders and the migration journal file.

## Dependencies
- drizzle-orm: For ORM and migration functionality
- postgres: For database connection
- dotenv: For loading environment variables
- fs: For file system operations
- path: For file path manipulations

## Testing Needs
- Integration tests with a test database to ensure migrations are applied correctly
- Error handling tests for various scenarios (e.g., missing POSTGRES_URL, invalid journal file)
- Tests for idempotency to ensure multiple runs don't cause issues

## Notes
- Ensure that the POSTGRES_URL environment variable is properly set before running migrations
- The script creates 'migrations' and 'meta' folders if they don't exist
- It validates or creates the '_journal.json' file in the 'meta' folder
- Consider implementing a rollback mechanism for failed migrations
- Log each step of the migration process for easier debugging
