# Session Management Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file provides functions for managing user sessions, including password hashing, JWT token generation and verification, and cookie-based session storage.

## Solution
The file exports several functions:

1. `hashPassword` and `comparePasswords`: For secure password handling
2. `signToken` and `verifyToken`: For JWT token management
3. `getSession` and `setSession`: For cookie-based session management

## Dependencies
- bcryptjs: For password hashing
- jose: For JWT operations
- next/headers: For cookie management
- Environment variables: For secret key storage

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for each function
- Integration tests for the full authentication flow
- Security testing to ensure proper encryption and token handling
- Performance testing, especially for password hashing

## Notes
- Uses environment variable `AUTH_SECRET` for JWT signing
- Sessions are set to expire after one day
- Implements secure cookie settings (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- Consider implementing token refresh mechanism for long-lived sessions

## Local Imports
- `@/lib/db/schema`: For NewUser type definition
