# Authentication Library Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file provides the core authentication functionality for the SaaS application.

## Solution
It likely implements the `useUser()` hook for client components and the `getUser()` function for server components, managing user authentication state.

## Dependencies
- May use a third-party authentication provider or a custom solution
- Likely interacts with the application's database for user data

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for individual authentication functions
- Integration tests to verify authentication flow
- Tests for different authentication scenarios (login, logout, session expiry)

## Notes
- Ensure that user data is securely handled and stored
- Verify compatibility with both client and server components in Next.js
- Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
