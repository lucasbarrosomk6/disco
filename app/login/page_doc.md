# Login page.tsx Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file implements the login page of the application, allowing users to authenticate and access their accounts.

## Solution
The file exports a React component that renders the login UI, which typically includes:
- Login form with email/username and password fields
- Submit button for form submission
- Links for password recovery and registration
- Possibly social login options

## Dependencies
- React and Next.js
- Form handling library (e.g., react-hook-form, Formik)
- Authentication hooks or context from NextAuth.js
- UI components from the project's component library

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for the login component and form validation
- Integration tests for the login flow
- Accessibility tests for form elements
- Error handling tests for invalid credentials

## Local File Imports
- UI components for forms and buttons
- Authentication hooks or utilities
- Validation schemas or functions
