# Root layout.tsx Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file provides the root layout for the entire application, wrapping all pages and applying global styles and components.

## Solution
The file exports a React component that serves as the root layout, including:
- HTML structure with `<head>` and `<body>` tags
- Global styles or CSS imports
- Context providers (e.g., for authentication, themes)
- Common UI elements that appear on all pages (e.g., header, footer)

## Dependencies
- React and Next.js
- Possibly CSS frameworks or global style imports
- Context providers from various parts of the application

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for the layout component
- Integration tests to ensure proper wrapping of child components
- Accessibility tests for global UI elements

## Local File Imports
- Global styles or CSS modules
- Context providers (e.g., AuthProvider, ThemeProvider)
- Common UI components (e.g., Header, Footer)
