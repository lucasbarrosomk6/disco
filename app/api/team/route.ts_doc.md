# Team API Route Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file implements the API endpoints for team-related operations in the SaaS application.

## Solution
It uses Next.js API routes to handle team-related requests such as creating, updating, or retrieving team information.

## Dependencies
- Likely uses Drizzle ORM for database operations
- May depend on authentication middleware for securing endpoints
- Probably uses zod for input validation

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for individual API handler functions
- Integration tests to verify correct database interactions
- Tests for error handling and edge cases

## Notes
- Ensure proper error handling and status codes are implemented
- Verify that all endpoints are properly authenticated
- Use zod for input validation to maintain data integrity
