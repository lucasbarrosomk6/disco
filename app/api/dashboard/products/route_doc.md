# Products API Route Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file implements API routes for handling product-related operations, including creating new products and fetching user products.

## Solution
The file exports two main functions:
1. POST: Creates a new product for the authenticated user
2. GET: Retrieves all products for the authenticated user

Both functions:
- Authenticate the user using the `getUser` function
- Interact with the database using Drizzle ORM
- Handle errors and return appropriate responses

## Dependencies
- Next.js API Routes
- Drizzle ORM
- Database schema (products table)
- Authentication utilities (getUser function)

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for POST and GET functions
- Integration tests with a test database
- Authentication tests
- Error handling tests for various scenarios (e.g., unauthorized access, database errors)

## Local File Imports
- Database connection from '@/lib/db/drizzle'
- Products schema from '@/lib/db/schema'
- getUser function from '@/lib/db/queries'

Note: Ensure proper error handling and logging for production use. Also, verify that the keyFeatures parsing logic is robust and handles potential JSON parsing errors gracefully.
