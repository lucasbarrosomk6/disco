# webhook/route.ts Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file handles incoming webhook events from Stripe, processing payment-related events and updating the application state accordingly.

## Solution
The file likely exports a route handler that:
- Verifies the incoming webhook signature
- Parses the event data
- Handles different event types (e.g., successful payments, failed payments, subscription updates)
- Updates the database or triggers other actions based on the event

## Dependencies
- Next.js API Routes
- Stripe library
- Database ORM (likely Drizzle based on project preferences)

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for individual event handling functions
- Integration tests with mocked Stripe events
- Error handling and security tests

## Local File Imports
- Stripe configuration (likely from an environment file)
- Database models or query functions
- Possibly utility functions for error handling or logging

Note: Ensure that proper error handling and logging are implemented for production use. Also, verify that the webhook secret is securely stored and accessed.
