# Stripe Checkout Route Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file handles the creation of Stripe Checkout sessions for processing payments or subscriptions in the application.

## Solution
The file likely exports a route handler that:
- Receives product or subscription details from the client
- Creates a Stripe Checkout session with the appropriate parameters
- Returns the session ID or URL to the client for redirecting to the Stripe Checkout page

## Dependencies
- Next.js API Routes
- Stripe library
- Possibly authentication middleware

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for session creation logic
- Integration tests simulating the checkout process
- Error handling tests for invalid inputs or Stripe API errors

## Local File Imports
- Stripe configuration settings
- Authentication utilities
- Possibly product or pricing models from the database

Note: Ensure that proper error handling is implemented and that sensitive information is not exposed to the client.
