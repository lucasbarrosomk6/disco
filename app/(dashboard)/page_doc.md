# Dashboard Page Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file implements the main dashboard page, providing an overview of key information and access to various features.

## Solution
The file exports a React component that:
- Renders a layout for the main dashboard view
- Possibly fetches and displays summary data or statistics
- Provides navigation to different sections of the dashboard

## Dependencies
- React and Next.js
- Possibly data fetching utilities (e.g., SWR, React Query)
- UI components from the project's component library

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for the Dashboard component
- Integration tests for data fetching and display
- Accessibility tests for dashboard elements

## Local File Imports
- UI components (e.g., cards, charts, navigation elements)
- Possibly hooks for authentication and data fetching
- Utility functions for data formatting or calculations

Note: Ensure that the dashboard layout is responsive and that data is properly refreshed or updated as needed.
