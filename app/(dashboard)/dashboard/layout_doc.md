# Dashboard Layout Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file solves the problem of creating a consistent layout for the dashboard pages in the Next.js SaaS starter application.

## Solution
The file implements a layout component that wraps all dashboard pages, providing a common structure and potentially shared UI elements like navigation or sidebars.

## Dependencies
- Likely depends on components from the `shadcn/ui` library for UI elements
- May use the `useUser()` hook for user authentication in client components

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for the layout component to ensure it renders correctly
- Integration tests to verify it properly wraps child components

## Notes
- Ensure this layout is consistent with the overall design system and uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Verify that it's properly integrated with the Next.js app router system

## Local Imports
- Likely imports from `@/components/ui` for shadcn/ui components
- May import `useUser` from `@/lib/auth`
- Possibly imports custom components from `@/components/dashboard`
