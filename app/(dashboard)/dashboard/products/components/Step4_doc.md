# Step4 Component Documentation

## Problem Solved
This component represents the fourth step in the product input process, focusing on problems solved by the product.

## Solution
The file exports a React component that:
- Renders a form field for describing problems solved by the product
- Uses React Hook Form for form state management
- Displays validation errors if any

## Dependencies
- React
- React Hook Form
- UI components: Textarea, Label

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for the Step4 component
- Validation tests for required fields
- Integration tests within the full product input flow

## Local File Imports
- UI components from '@/components/ui/textarea' and '@/components/ui/label'

Note: Ensure that this component integrates well with the overall product input flow and that its validation works correctly within the larger form context.
