# Step1 Component Documentation

## Problem Solved
This component represents the first step in the product input process, focusing on basic product information.

## Solution
The file exports a React component that:
- Renders form fields for product name and tagline
- Uses React Hook Form for form state management
- Displays validation errors if any

## Dependencies
- React
- React Hook Form
- UI components: Input, Label

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for the Step1 component
- Validation tests for required fields
- Integration tests within the full product input flow

## Local File Imports
- UI components from '@/components/ui/input' and '@/components/ui/label'

Note: Ensure that this component integrates well with the overall product input flow and that its validation works correctly within the larger form context.
