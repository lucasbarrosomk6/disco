# Step3 Component Documentation

## Problem Solved
This component represents the third step in the product input process, focusing on key features of the product.

## Solution
The file exports a React component that:
- Renders a dynamic list of input fields for key features
- Allows adding and removing feature inputs
- Uses React Hook Form and useFieldArray for form state management
- Displays validation errors if any

## Dependencies
- React
- React Hook Form (useFieldArray)
- UI components: Input, Label, Button

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for the Step3 component
- Tests for adding and removing feature inputs
- Validation tests for required fields
- Integration tests within the full product input flow

## Local File Imports
- UI components from '@/components/ui/input', '@/components/ui/label', and '@/components/ui/button'

Note: Ensure that this component handles dynamic form fields correctly and integrates well with the overall product input flow.
