# Add Product Page Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file implements the add product page, allowing users to create new products using a multi-step form.

## Solution
The file exports a React component that:
- Renders a multi-step form for adding product details
- Uses React Hook Form with Zod validation for form management
- Handles form submission and creates a new product in the database

## Dependencies
- React and Next.js
- React Hook Form with Zod validation
- UI components: Button
- Custom components: Step1, Step2, Step3, Step4, Step5, Step6, ProgressBar

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for the AddProductPage component
- Integration tests for form submission and API calls
- Tests for form validation and error handling
- Tests for multi-step navigation

## Local File Imports
- UI components from '@/components/ui/button'
- Step components from '../components/Step1', '../components/Step2', etc.
- ProgressBar component from '../components/ProgressBar'

Note: Ensure that API calls are properly mocked in tests to avoid actual database insertions during testing.
