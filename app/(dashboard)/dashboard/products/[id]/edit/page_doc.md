# Edit Product Page Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file implements the edit product page, allowing users to modify existing product details.

## Solution
The file exports a React component that:
- Fetches existing product data based on the product ID
- Renders a multi-step form for editing product details
- Handles form submission and updates the product in the database

## Dependencies
- React and Next.js
- React Hook Form with Zod validation
- UI components: Button, Loading
- Custom components: Step1, Step2, Step3, Step4, Step5, Step6

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for the EditProductPage component
- Integration tests for form submission and API calls
- Tests for form validation and error handling
- Tests for loading states and data fetching

## Local File Imports
- UI components from '@/components/ui/button' and '@/components/ui/loading'
- Step components from '../components/Step1', '../components/Step2', etc.

Note: Ensure that API calls are properly mocked in tests to avoid actual database updates during testing.
