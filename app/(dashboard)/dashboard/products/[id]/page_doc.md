# View Product Page Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file implements the view product page, displaying detailed information about a specific product.

## Solution
The file exports a React component that:
- Fetches product details based on the product ID
- Renders a card with comprehensive product information
- Provides options to edit the product or return to the product list

## Dependencies
- React and Next.js
- UI components: Button, Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle
- Custom component: Loading

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for the ViewProductPage component
- Integration tests for data fetching and display
- Tests for loading and error states
- Accessibility tests for the product information display

## Local File Imports
- UI components from '@/components/ui/button' and '@/components/ui/card'
- Loading component from '@/components/ui/loading'

Note: Ensure that API calls are properly mocked in tests to avoid actual database queries during testing.
