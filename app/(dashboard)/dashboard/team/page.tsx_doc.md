# Team Dashboard Page Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file implements the team management page within the dashboard, allowing users to view and manage their team members.

## Solution
It creates a React component that displays team information and potentially provides functionality for adding, removing, or updating team members.

## Dependencies
- Uses the dashboard layout component
- Likely uses the `useUser()` hook for authentication in client components
- May depend on API calls to `/api/team` for data fetching and mutations

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for individual components and functions within the page
- Integration tests to verify correct interaction with the API
- User interface tests to ensure proper rendering and user interactions

## Notes
- Ensure that the page follows the established design system and uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement proper loading states for asynchronous operations
- Verify that the page is responsive and accessible
