# General Page Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file implements the general settings page in the dashboard, allowing users to update their account information.

## Solution
The file exports a React component that:
- Renders a form for updating user name and email
- Uses the `useActionState` hook for form submission and state management
- Handles form submission and displays success/error messages

## Dependencies
- React and Next.js
- UI components: Button, Input, Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle, Label
- Lucide icons
- Custom hooks: useUser, useActionState
- Server action: updateAccount

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for the GeneralPage component
- Integration tests for form submission and error handling
- Accessibility tests for form elements
- Tests for different states (loading, success, error)

## Local File Imports
- UI components from '@/components/ui/button', '@/components/ui/input', etc.
- useUser hook from '@/lib/auth'
- updateAccount action from '@/app/(login)/actions'

Note: Ensure that the updateAccount action is properly mocked in tests to avoid actual account updates during testing.
