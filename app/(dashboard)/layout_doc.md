# Dashboard Layout Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file provides a consistent layout structure for all pages within the dashboard section of the application.

## Solution
The file exports a React component that:
- Wraps all dashboard pages with a common layout
- Likely includes navigation elements (e.g., sidebar, header)
- Possibly handles authentication checks for protected routes

## Dependencies
- React and Next.js
- UI components for layout and navigation
- Possibly authentication context or hooks

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for the layout component
- Integration tests for navigation functionality
- Accessibility tests for layout elements

## Local File Imports
- UI components for layout and navigation
- Possibly authentication hooks or context
- Utility functions for layout-related calculations or checks

Note: Ensure that the layout is consistent across different dashboard pages and that it adapts well to different screen sizes.
