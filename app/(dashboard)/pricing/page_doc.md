# Pricing Page Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file implements the pricing page, displaying different subscription plans and allowing users to select a plan.

## Solution
The file exports a React component that:
- Renders a list of pricing plans with their features and prices
- Uses the `useFormState` hook for handling form submissions
- Integrates with server actions for updating team subscriptions
- Provides a responsive layout for different screen sizes

## Dependencies
- React and Next.js
- UI components: Button, Image
- Custom components: PricingCard
- Icons from Lucide React
- Server actions: updateTeamSubscription

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for the PricingPage and PricingCard components
- Integration tests for form submission and server action interaction
- Accessibility tests for pricing information and selection process
- Responsive design tests for various screen sizes

## Local File Imports
- UI components from '@/components/ui/button'
- Server actions from './actions'
- SVG icon from '@/app/icon.svg'

Note: Ensure that pricing information is easily updatable and that the component handles loading and error states gracefully.
