# Submit Button Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file implements a reusable submit button component with loading state for form submissions.

## Solution
The file exports a React component that:
- Renders a button with dynamic text and icon based on submission state
- Uses the `useFormStatus` hook to determine if a form is being submitted
- Provides visual feedback during form submission with a loading spinner

## Dependencies
- React
- UI components: Button
- Icons from Lucide React
- React DOM hooks: useFormStatus

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for the SubmitButton component
- Tests for different states (idle, loading)
- Accessibility tests for the button in various states

## Local File Imports
- UI components from '@/components/ui/button'
- Icons from 'lucide-react'

Note: Ensure that the button's appearance and behavior are consistent with the overall design system and that it provides clear feedback to users during form submissions.
