# Pricing Actions Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file defines server actions for handling subscription updates and pricing-related operations.

## Solution
The file likely exports functions that:
- Handle team subscription updates
- Interact with the database to update subscription information
- Possibly integrate with Stripe or another payment processor for subscription management

## Dependencies
- Next.js server actions
- Database ORM (likely Drizzle based on project preferences)
- Possibly Stripe API or another payment processor library

## Testing Needs
- Unit tests for individual action functions
- Integration tests with mocked database and payment processor interactions
- Error handling tests for various scenarios (e.g., invalid inputs, API failures)

## Local File Imports
- Database models or query functions
- Utility functions for error handling or data validation
- Possibly configuration settings for payment processing

Note: Ensure that all sensitive operations are properly secured and that error handling is robust for production use.
