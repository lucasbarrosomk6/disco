# .gitignore Documentation

## Problem Solved
This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git version control, preventing sensitive or unnecessary files from being committed to the repository.

## Solution
The file contains a list of file patterns and directory names that Git should ignore. Typical entries include:
- Node modules directory
- Environment files with sensitive information
- Build output directories
- Log files
- IDE-specific files and directories
- Operating system-specific files (e.g., .DS_Store for macOS)

## Dependencies
- Git version control system

## Testing Needs
- Verify that specified files and directories are indeed ignored by Git
- Ensure that no sensitive information is accidentally committed

## Local File Imports
- N/A (This file doesn't import other files)

Note: Review the actual contents of the .gitignore file to ensure all necessary items are included and no important files are accidentally ignored.
